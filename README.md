# Bash Script Development Environment Setup

This README provides step-by-step instructions to set up the development environment for Bash script development, specifically for replicating the Unix `cat` command. Follow these instructions to ensure a consistent and functional setup.

## IDE/Editor Configuration

1. **Select an IDE/Editor:**
   - Recommended: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Vim.

2. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
   - Download and install from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. **Configure Visual Studio Code:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Install the following extensions:
     - **Bash IDE**: Provides syntax highlighting and code intelligence.
     - **ShellCheck**: Offers linting support for Bash scripts.
   - To install extensions:
     - Open the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
     - Search for the extension names and click "Install".

## Tool Verification

1. **Verify Essential Tools:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Check if `curl` and `jq` are installed:
     ```bash
     curl --version
     jq --version
     ```
   - If not installed, run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install curl jq
     ```

2. **Check Bash Version:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     bash --version
     ```
   - Ensure it is the latest stable version. Update if necessary using:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install bash
     ```

## Version Control

1. **Initialize a Git Repository:**
   - In your project directory, run:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Create a .gitignore File:**
   - Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project directory.
   - Add the following entries to exclude unnecessary files:
     ```
     # Ignore editor-specific files
     .vscode/
     *.swp

     # Ignore temporary files
     *.tmp
     ```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have a fully configured and optimized development environment for Bash scripting. This setup ensures readiness for subsequent tasks in the project and facilitates efficient development and collaboration.
